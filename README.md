The Intelligent System that was implemented for this course suggests recipes based on a list of ingredients 
provided by the user. The System consists of four different files: 

- **Jupyter Notebook**: used to load and process the data. 
- **Python File**: used by the user to interact with the Intelligent System by providing a list of ingredients and 
receiving recipe suggestions. Two different versions of the Intelligent System were implemented: 
  - The software can suggest recipes that contain **only** the ingredients provided by the user. 
  - The software can suggest recipes that contain the ingredients provided by the user but also includes other 
  ingredients. 
- *full_dataset.csv*: the original Dataset obtained from the website https://recipenlg.cs.put.poznan.pl/dataset
- *correct_data.csv*: the Datset used by the Intelligent System obtained after processing the original Dataset.
